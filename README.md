# Where Did You Eat?

## Description 

An app to track restaurants that you visit. With this app you create a "visit", along with a Restaurant, which is either found by searching Yelp, or using a previously created object of it. The user then enters the date of the visit to the restaurant as well as a short description of the visit and the restaurant (or whatever I'm not the cops). The User can view all of thier visits on their homepage. 

This app is built using Ruby on Rails v5.2.3
Gems used include:
`bootstrap`
`omniauth`
`omniauth-oauth2`
`omniauth-google-oauth2`
`jquery-rails`
`bcrypt`
`http`

This app also uses the Yelp API
